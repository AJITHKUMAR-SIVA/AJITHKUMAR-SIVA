1.)Write the definition of tuple with a proper example? 

A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas.

A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc.).

# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)

OUTPUT
()
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 'Hello', 3.4)
('mouse', [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

2.) Write the code for implementing sub dictionary inside dictionary? 
A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside a dictionary. It's a collection of dictionaries into one single dictionary.

nested_dict = { 'dictA': {'key_1': 'value_1'},
                'dictB': {'key_2': 'value_2'}}
Here, the nested_dict is a nested dictionary with the dictionary dictA and dictB. They are two dictionary each having own key and value.
EXAMPLE:-
people = {1: {'name': 'John', 'age': '27', 'sex': 'Male'},
          2: {'name': 'Marie', 'age': '22', 'sex': 'Female'}}

print(people)
When we run above program, 
it will output:

{1: {'name': 'John', 'age': '27', '
